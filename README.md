# Capstone-Project-Unsupervised

The main objective of this project is to bring out the insights hidden in the dataset and bringing out some answers to the questions like what type of content is preferred the most? Do people really prefer watching shows over movies? What are the type of content the people generally love to watch and many more. We will be performing Exploratory Data Analysis to answer these questions and finally we will be clustering the content based on the features which help the platform giving better recommendations and keep their customers engaged.
